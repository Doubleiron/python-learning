#censor
'''Write a function called censor that takes two strings, text and word, as input. It should return the text with the word you chose replaced with asterisks. For example:

censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack")
should return:

"this **** is wack ****"
Assume your input strings won't contain punctuation or upper case letters.
The number of asterisks you put should correspond to the number of letters in the censored word.

      copy.append('*'*len(word))
    else:
